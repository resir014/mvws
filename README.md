> Minimum Viable Webpack Starter™ - Webpack but with only the bare essentials to get you up and running.

Based on [this tweet](https://twitter.com/resir014/status/971702166434889729) by yours truly.

## What is this?

The team at [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) have been doing an awesome job with Webpack 4, to the point where you can now start a project with as little boilerplate as possible. With Webpack 4, this is all you need for a working React app.

This starter is not really a starter at all. It's just a proof of concept that Webpack needn't be hard.

Feel free to use this starter and expand it to your liking, though. I'm interested to see what you're building next. ❤️

## Getting started

You will need:

* Node.js (v8.0+)
* (Optional) An HTTP server (I recommend [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve))

```bash
# First, install your dependencies by running:
npm install

# Then, start Webpack in watch mode.
npm start

# You're all set! You can now open `index.html` in your favourite browser.

# You can also start a local development server to view your project.
# This will run your app at localhost:5000 (depending on the client you use)
serve
```
